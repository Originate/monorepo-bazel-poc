# Scalable Build System POC

This is a proof of concept of a mono-repo compiled by the [scalabel Bazel build system](https://bazel.build).

### Install

- clone this repo

### Compile everything

...

### Start the server

...

### Changes

- change the `com.acme.shared.Hello` method to return "Hello world"
- see that it recompiles only this library
